## ShowDamage 
### What does this do?
This is a simple (yet configurable) plugin that allows to see the damage done to any entity. This is how it looks:

Non critical damage dealt by an entity:

Critical damage dealt by an entity has an indicator:

Damage dealt to entity plus sweep attack to other entity (can be disabled in config):

Damage dealt to entity with an explosion by block (or entity):

The plugin also has a message output if damage was caused by a projectile:
